Coding practices:
  converted tabs to spaces (to preserve formatting accross editors)
  
Overall name changes: (for clarity, to be more general, and/or to avoid ambiguity)
  "breeder" preffix --> "load"
  "module"          --> "loader" or "sheet"
  
Renamed files and directories, added new:
  trait_loader.pl (uploading_data.pl)
  includes/
    trait_helpers.pm (breeder_helper.pm)
    PG_Database
  loaders/ (modules)
    load_<sheet name>.pm (breeder_<sheet name>.pm)
  verifiers/ (NEW)
    verify <sheet name>.pm (NEW)

Added configuration file, trait_loader.conf.

get_data_info()
  removed LABEL because not requesting user to select a source
  removed S_TYPE because there shouldn't be special-case code in core
  removed TARGET_DB because it's defined in configuration file
  added S_DB_NAME

update_data_info()
  changed name to get_cvs()
  does not create cv records

set_module_info()
  changed name to set_loader_info

pre_processing()
  changed name to preprocess()

post_processing
  changed name to postprocess()
    
Open questions:
  would there be need for multiple trait cvs?
